    title: "Patent: Ultrasonic Flaw detector",
    description: "The invention presents a defect-detection system integrating non-destructive testing (NDT), machine learning, ultrasonic sensing, and Raspberry Pi technology to identify flaws without damaging the object. It uses a hybrid model to improve detection accuracy and visualize defects through data-driven tools. Ultrasonic sensors and Raspberry Pi enable precise measurement of defect depth and location. LED indicators help differentiate defective and non-defective areas in real time. Future upgrades include automated motion with speed-controlled wheels and LCD displays for live graphs and values, offering a low-cost yet highly accurate solution.",

    title: "Osteoporosis Prediction using Machine Learning: An XGBoost Approach for Early Detection",
    description: "Early osteoporosis detection is limited by costly and inaccessible tools like DXA, so this study proposes a radiation-free, machine-learning-based screening model using XGBoost. The optimized model delivers strong performance with 92% accuracy, 98% precision, 85% recall, and an AUC-ROC of 0.93. Comprehensive preprocessing, feature engineering, imbalance handling, and SHAP-based explainability strengthen its clinical reliability. Comparisons show that the tuned XGBoost model outperforms Random Forest, Logistic Regression, GaussianNB, and the baseline XGBoost. Overall, the work highlights AI as a scalable, affordable screening solution that enables earlier diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.",

    title: "Generative AI for Personalized Energy Consumption Behavior Analysis",
    description: "Generative AI, digital energy twins, and behavioral modeling are transforming modern energy systems into intelligent, adaptive, and human-centered ecosystems by improving forecasting, generating synthetic data, and enabling multi-scale scenario simulations through models like GANs, VAEs, transformers, and diffusion networks. By revealing behavioral, cultural, and psychological drivers of consumption, these tools support personalized insights, anomaly detection, and real-time energy recommendations. Combined with IoT-driven optimization, smart-grid resilience, policy simulation, and climate-ready planning—all grounded in ethical and inclusive AI—they lay the foundation for decentralized, user-aware energy networks that promote a more sustainable, fair, and efficient energy future.",
